        <div class="about-desc">
          <p>In an ideal world we would not need to create a specialised ME and FM database for physicians and other healthcare practitioners.</p>
          <p>In an ideal world, there would be an adequate number of health care professionals who are very knowledgeable about ME and FM; there would be testing and treatments, all covered by MSP.</p>
          <p>In an ideal world, there would be no stigma, no need for patients to be exposed to a health care system that more often than not treats them as malingers or psychiatric patients who just need to “push” themselves and get over it.</p>
