<div class="container text-left jumbotron">
  
  <h4>In an ideal world we would not need to create a specialised ME and FM
  database for physicians and other healthcare practitioners.</h4>

  <h4>In an ideal world, there would be an adequate number of health care professionals
    who are very knowledgeable about ME and FM; there would be testing and treatments,
    all covered by MSP.</h4>

  <h4>In an ideal world, there would be no stigma,
    no need for patients to be exposed to a health care system that more often
    than not treats them as malingers or psychiatric patients who just need to
    “push” themselves and get over it.</h4>
